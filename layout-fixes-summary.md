# Game Cards Layout Fix

## Problem Fixed
The game selection cards were overlapping and stacking incorrectly due to:
- **Grid Layout Issue**: Using `grid-cols-4` with 7 cards caused uneven rows (4 + 3 cards)
- **Aspect Ratio Conflicts**: `aspect-video` was creating inconsistent heights
- **Poor Responsiveness**: Fixed grid didn't adapt well to different screen sizes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Responsive Grid System**
```css
grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4
```
- **Mobile**: 1 column (stacked vertically)
- **Tablet**: 2 columns 
- **Desktop**: 3 columns
- **Large Desktop**: 4 columns

### 2. **Fixed Card Heights**
```css
h-40 /* Fixed height of 160px */
```
- **Consistent Height**: All cards now have uniform 160px height
- **No Overlapping**: Fixed height prevents content overflow issues
- **Better Alignment**: Cards align properly in grid rows

### 3. **Improved Card Structure**
```css
flex flex-col justify-between
```
- **Flexible Layout**: Content distributes evenly within each card
- **Better Spacing**: Title and description have proper spacing
- **Consistent Appearance**: All cards look uniform regardless of text length

### 4. **Enhanced Spacing**
```css
gap-6 /* Increased from gap-4 */
```
- **Better Separation**: More space between cards prevents visual crowding
- **Cleaner Look**: Cards have breathing room for better UX
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger gaps improve mobile interaction

### 5. **Auto-Row Sizing**
```css
auto-rows-fr
```
- **Equal Row Heights**: All rows maintain consistent height
- **Prevents Stacking Issues**: Cards won't overlap or misalign
- **Grid Stability**: Maintains proper grid structure

## Technical Details

```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop View**: Verify 4 cards per row (3+3+1 layout)

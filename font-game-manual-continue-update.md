# Font Identification Game Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. **Limited to 10 Random Questions**
- Modified `shuffleGameData()` function to select only 10 random fonts from the 17 available
- Used `shuffleArray(FONT_OPTIONS).slice(0, 10)` to randomly pick 10 fonts for each game session
- Each time you start a new game, you'll get a different random selection of 10 fonts

### 2. **Added Manual Continue System**
- **Removed automatic timeout** - the game no longer automatically proceeds after 2-6 seconds
- **Added `waitingForContinue` state** to track when the game is paused for reading
- **Added `handleContinue()` function** to handle progression to the next question

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **Continue Button**: After answering a question, a "Continue" button appears below the educational feedback
- **Disabled Buttons**: Answer buttons are disabled while showing feedback and waiting for continue
- **Better Reading Time**: Players can now take as much time as they need to read the educational information
- **Increased Feedback Area**: Expanded from 80px to 120px height to accommodate the continue button

### 4. **Updated Game Flow**
```
1. Player selects an answer
2. Educational feedback is shown immediately
3. Game pauses - answer buttons are disabled
4. "Continue" button appears with animation
5. Player clicks "Continue" when ready
6. Game proceeds to next question or completion screen
```

### 5. **Technical Implementation**
- **New State Variable**: `waitingForContinue` tracks pause state
- **Enhanced Button Logic**: Answer buttons check both `showFeedback` and `waitingForContinue` for disable state
- **Clean State Management**: All new states are properly reset in `resetGame()` and "Play Again" functions
- **Smooth Animations**: Continue button has entrance animation and hover effects

## Benefits

### **Educational Focus**
- Players can read font information at their own pace
- No pressure to quickly absorb educational content
- Better learning retention through self-paced reading

### **Random Variety**
- 10 questions instead of 17 makes games more focused
- Different font selection each playthrough increases replayability
- Prevents predictable patterns in question order

### **User Control**

- More relaxed, educational experience
- Better accessibility for different reading speeds

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start Font Identification Game** - Verify it shows "Question 1 of 10"
2. **Answer a Question** - Check that feedback appears with educational info
3. **Continue Button** - Verify continue button appears and works
4. **Button States** - Confirm answer buttons are disabled during feedback
5. **Play Again** - Test that new random 10 fonts are selected
6. **Completion Screen** - Verify final score shows "X / 10"

## Future Enhancements

- Could add keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Space for continue)
- Option to toggle between manual/automatic progression
- Difficulty levels with different numbers of questions (5, 10, 15)
- Time tracking for educational analytics
